# Simple Moving Average Based Strategies.

Within this repository we define the Golden Cross Strategy and Trend Based Signal System.

The Golden Cross Strategy is a double moving average based strategy in which bullish momentum is defined  by the fast-period moving average crossing above the slow-period moving average, and bearish momentum is defined by the fast-period moving average crossing below the slow-period moving average.

The Trend Based Signal System is based on a fast and slow period moving average, bullish momentum is based on the fast-period moving average moving above the slow-period moving average and bearish momentum is based on it moving below the slow-period moving average.

When we receive a bullish candlestick pattern while price has bullish momentum, a bullish signal is output.
When we receicve a bearish candlestick pattern while price has bearish momentum, a bearish signal is output.

The Golden Cross Strategy is based on procedural coding in MQL5.
The Trend Based Signal System is based on Object Oriented Programming, the classes required for the System are stored in the IcludeTutorial Folder.
